verror 19
# 
# common Message # 19:
# The specified library could not be accessed at the specified location.
# Verify that the directories in the path exist and have the proper access
# permissions and that the "_info" file (with proper access permissions)
# exists.  This message might be preceded or followed by another message
# that gives more information about the problem.
# 
# The vlib command creates a ModelSim library.  The vmap command creates
# the map from a logical library name to the physical library (directory).
# Use the vmap command without arguments to find out how all the libraries
# are mapped.  In the absence of a mapping, the library is searched for in
# the current working directory.
# 
# One way this problem can occur is if the mapping for the library in your
# modelsim.ini file contains an environment variable that is not set
# in your environment.
# 
# This error message can be suppressed or downgraded to a note or warning
